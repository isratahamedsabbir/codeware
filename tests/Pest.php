| Expectations

|
| When you're writing tests, you often need to check that values meet certain conditions. The

| While Pest is very powerful out-of-the-box, you may have some testing code specific to your
| project that you don't want to repeat in every file. Here you can also expose helpers as
| global functions to help you to reduce the number of lines of code in your test files.
